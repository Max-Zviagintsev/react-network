# React Network
**NodeJS** application with a **React** Front-End and **MongoDB** database i.e. built with **MERN** stack.


Users can register for free and create a developer profile to communicate with each other, post and comment. 


Avatar is automatically taken from the Gravatar profile connected to user's email. GitHub profile is fetched through the API, the user just needs to add his GitHub username to the profile. 

I used Semantic-UI-React library for simple layout and didn't do much styling in this particular project to concentrate my efforts on a **NodeJS** back-end stuff like user authorization, database management with **Mongoose** etc.
